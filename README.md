# Profanity-Detector

This is a discord bot. It continuously scans **chat to filter out profanity within the server**.

Moderators decide on which words to censor, including swear words, words associated with hate speech, harassment, etc.

It **warns the user for first two mistakes then finally kicks the user out of the server**.
A cooldown timer gurantees that a user can have another chance.

Requirement:
- An online host where bot can be hosted.
- A role who can kick the users from the server.
